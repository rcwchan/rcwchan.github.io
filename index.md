I am a computer vision engineer with 5 years of experience in vision-based deep learning for real-world robotic manipulation and autonomous machine operation.

From 2018-2020, I was a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I completed my MSc in March 2020. 
I performed research on semi-supervised genome annotation methods in the <a href="https://hoffmanlab.org/">Hoffman lab</a> under the supervision of Prof. Michael Hoffman. From 2020-2022, I worked in Tokyo, Japan as a robotics & computer vision engineer at DeepX, Inc, developing vision-based deep learning technologies for scene comprehension in unstructured environments.

Since 2022, I have been working at Sony Research as a Computer Vision Engineer on vision-based deep learning for deformable object manipulation.

My general research interests include (but are not limited to):

<ul>
    <li>2D/3D object detection & pose estimation</li>
    <li>computer vision x machine learning for robot actuation</li>
    <li>statistical learning theory</li>
    <li>high-performance computing</li>
</ul>

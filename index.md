I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto.
I am currently doing research on semi-supervised genome annotation methods in the [Hoffman lab](https://hoffmanlab.org/) under the supervision of Prof. Michael Hoffman.

My general research interests include (but are not limited to):

* probabilistic learning
* deep learning
* statistical learning theory
* high-performance computing

From 2018-2020, I was a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto. I completed my MSc in March 2020. 
I performed research on semi-supervised genome annotation methods in the <a href="https://hoffmanlab.org/">Hoffman lab</a> under the supervision of Prof. Michael Hoffman.

My general research interests include (but are not limited to):

<ul>
    <li>probabilistic learning</li>
    <li>deep learning</li>
    <li>statistical learning theory</li>
    <li>high-performance computing</li>
</ul>
